#PyGilt
A Python client binding for the Gilt API

##Documentation
There isn't any :< message [me](http://github.com/mnn2104) on github if you want some.  
I could scare up some docstrings or something I guess.

##Testing
I did it all in my bpython shell, and forgot to save it to a file.  Sorry guys.  
Message me if you want some.

##Setup
You'll need to setup the requests module (only supported by python 2.6 and up). requests depends on certifi.

You can pip install certifi as:
$ sudo pip install certifi

And get requests with:
$ git clone git@github.com:kennethreitz/requests
$ python setup.py install
